## Lab: Hangman

#### Overview

For today's lab you will be recreating a classic game: Hangman!

You will be working **in pairs** on this assignment. That means you can only use **one computer** to code on. This will be a great exercise in pair programming. Feel free to switch between the "Driver" and "Navigator" roles throughout the lab.

**YOU MUST** spend 30 minutes pseudo-coding your plan for the lab before typing out any Javascript.  

#### Technical Requirements

Your game must...

* Render in the browser.
* Include separate HTML/CSS/Javascript files.
  - We have provided you with some starter code. Feel free to make changes to it.
* Use Javascript and/or jQuery for DOM manipulation.

#### Minimum Requirements

* Player 1 can enter a word that will be guessed during the game.
* The word is then hidden and represented by blank spaces.
* Player 2 enters a letter and clicks a button to submit their guess.
* If the letter is present, it is revealed.
* If not, the number of turns left is decremented.
* NOTE: No images are required!

#### Bonuses

Feel free to take on any/all of these!  

* Show each letter as it's guessed.
* All 26 letters are shown and can be clicked on.
  * When the user clicks a letter, it is grayed out and rendered unclickable for the rest of the game.
* Create a visual representation of the hangman (e.g., stick figure).
* Have the game randomly pick a word from a dictionary. This means the user would not have to submit a word at the start of the game.
* Add a timer to the game.
